# Project Finance

Finance is a web application that allows user to register, login, check current stock prices and buy or sell stocks.
For the purpose of this demo, each user gets virtual 10,000$ to spend on stocks.

Checking current prices and evaluating value of stocks owned by user is done with IEX API.
